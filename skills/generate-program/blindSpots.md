# Review Blind Spots

The failure modes that pass typecheck, pass lint, pass tests, and still fall short of the bar. `generate-program` walks this list in its Phase 6 review; `audit-program` walks it in Phase 5. This file is the single canonical copy. Update it here and both skills inherit the change.

Each entry has a stable slug in its heading. Cross-reference by slug, never by position, so inserting an entry can't silently repoint every reference.

For each item, output one line: `<slug>: clean | flagged at <file:line>: <issue>`. Silence is not a pass.

> Example paths are written for a consumer project with the Foldkit subtree vendored at `repos/foldkit/`. Working inside the Foldkit repo itself, drop that prefix; the same paths exist at the project root.

## Logic

### `off-by-one`

Logic with "after N", modulo, "every Nth", counter thresholds, or cycle boundaries. Trace for N=0, N=1, and the first transition. `count % 4 === 0` triggers on count=0. Intended or bug?

### `skip-reset-semantics`

Skip, reset, cancel, undo. Trace what each does to counters and derived state. Does skip increment the counter or bypass it? Does reset preserve it? Is the behavior what a user would expect?

### `state-machine-edges`

For every discriminated-union state: can the code transition INTO every state? OUT of every state? Are there dead states (created, never entered)? States that should be reachable but aren't?

When the answer takes real tracing, that is the signal to reach for `Machine` (`foldkit/experimental`, with `to` / `when` / `otherwise` from `foldkit/experimental/machine`). Writing the transitions as a table makes the edge set enumerable data instead of control flow spread across update handlers, and the Machine then answers this blind spot by computation rather than by reading:

- `unreachableStates()` returns the states nothing transitions into.
- `deadTransitions()` returns edges that can never fire, tagged `UnreachableSource` or `ShadowedByOtherwise`.
- `reachableFrom(tag)` gives the closure from any state, and `toMermaid()` renders the diagram for review.

Recommend it when a flow has several states, guarded transitions, or edges that are easy to get wrong (checkout, onboarding, multi-step approval, connection lifecycles). `repos/foldkit/examples/state-machine/` is the reference. Don't push it on a three-state union that one `M.tagsExhaustive` already handles legibly; the table costs more than it saves there. The module is under `experimental/`, so say so when recommending it.

### `derived-data-in-model`

Fields computable from other fields. `endTime` AND `remainingMs` on the same state, where one can drift from the other. Flag unless there's a documented reason (view needs pure data, etc.).

### `dead-variants-and-noop-commands`

Variants set but never observed by the view or other updates. Fields written but never read. Commands whose result Message handler is `[model, []]`.

The **no-op startup Command**: `init` returns `[DEFAULT_MODEL, [triggerApplicationStarted]]`, the Command resolves to `ApplicationStarted()`, and the handler is `ApplicationStarted: () => [model, []]`. Give the Command real work (load preferences, fetch initial data, focus first input, restore session) or delete the Command and the Message together.

The **navigate-before-save**: a handler returning BOTH a save Command and a navigation Command races the save against the navigation. (`pushUrl` is an `Effect`, not a Command; it reaches a handler wrapped in one, as `Command.define('PushUrl', { args: { url: S.String }, messages: [CompletedPushUrl], execute: ({ url }) => pushUrl(url).pipe(Effect.as(CompletedPushUrl())) })`.) Which one lands first is timing, not something the handler decides, and a navigation is local while a save is a round trip, so the route has almost always changed by the time the save resolves. The failure Message still arrives and the handler still runs; the error just renders on a route the user didn't submit from, or on one whose view doesn't render it at all. Idiomatic: emit the save only, then navigate in the `Succeeded*` handler, so errors surface on the page the user is still looking at.

For every union variant, trace whether the view branches on it and whether that branch is reachable. For every Model field, trace whether anything reads it besides its own writes.

## Structure and decomposition

### `repeated-scaffolding`

Three or four handlers sharing the same 5-line scaffold (`M.tag` + `M.orElse`, `Option.match` + fallback) want a named helper. Genuinely duplicated decision logic, not coincidentally similar shape.

Specific case: the update return type written inline at every update site. The convention is to name it once per file:

```ts
type UpdateReturn = Update.Return<Model, Message>
const withUpdateReturn = M.withReturnType<UpdateReturn>()
```

`Update.ReturnWithOutMessage<Model, Message, OutMessage>` is the Submodel counterpart.

**Flag the repetition, not the spelling.** Writing the tuple out as `type UpdateReturn = readonly [Model, ReadonlyArray<Command.Command<Message>>]` is what most examples still do (kanban, auth, job-application); `Update.Return` is the tidier spelling and the right default for new code, but a hand-written alias is not a finding. What is a finding: no alias at all, with the full tuple repeated at the signature and again inside `M.withReturnType<...>()`.

### `functions-doing-two-things`

Orchestrators mixing "decide what to do" with "do it." Helpers whose `if` branches into unrelated behaviors. Handlers that conflate the state decision with the command decision.

### `manual-cache-orchestration`

Handlers that hand-thread several cache writes and refetches after a mutation succeeds. `Update.combine(model, [step, step, ...])` sequences update steps over one Model, and `Update.refresh({ read, revalidate, write, load })` builds a step that reloads a cache only when it actually holds data. A `Succeeded*` handler doing this by hand with nested `evo` calls and conditional Command arrays should use them.

## Naming

### `naming-drift`

`Updated*` here, `Changed*` there for the same kind of event. `whenX` here, `handleX` there for analogous cases. One file, one idiom.

### `messages-naming-the-effect`

A Message named `Incremented` describes the resulting state change, not the user action. The convention is verb-first past-tense for the EVENT that caused the update: `ClickedIncrement`. Same trap with `Saved`, `Deleted`, `Added`. The right names: `ClickedSave`, `ClickedDelete`, `ClickedAdd`, `SucceededSave`. Look for Messages that read like state mutations rather than user actions or external events.

### `view-named-after-namespace`

A counter feature exporting `counter(model)` reads as `Counter.counter(model)` at call sites. Name the primary view function `view`, so call sites read `Counter.view(model, h)`, `Home.view(model, h)`, `Room.view(model, h)`. The namespace disambiguates; the function name carries the role.

### `unearned-type-aliases`

`export const Model = S.Struct({...})` followed by `export type Model = typeof Model.Type`.

**Do not flag this by default.** It is idiomatic the moment the decoded type is referenced across modules in handler or parameter positions: `typeof Foo` is the constructor type Command consumes, so any consumer needing the decoded shape must otherwise write `typeof Foo.Type` at every call site. The exemplars export these aliases extensively for exactly that reason. Library exports whose type is part of a public API (e.g. `ViewConfig` callback parameters) are the same case.

Flag only when the schema is used purely locally with no consumer referencing its type, or when consumers already write `typeof Foo.Type` directly and the alias sits unused.

## Effect and Foldkit idiom

### `effect-module-inconsistency`

Mixing `items.map(f)` and `Array.map(items, f)` in the same file. Mixing `Option.match` and `Option.map(...).pipe(Option.getOrElse(...))` for similar code. One file, one idiom.

### `stuttery-evo-setters`

An `evo` setter that only transforms that same field should be point-free: `entries: Array.map(revealErrors)`, `count: Number.increment`, `priceSlider: Slider.reflectRange({ min: minPrice, max: maxPrice })`. Flag `entries: () => Array.map(model.entries, revealErrors)` and friends. Replacement values from Messages, child updates, Commands, or other Model fields still use `() => value`.

### `empty-object-constructors`

`foldkit/no-empty-object-tagged-call` catches the bare-identifier form (`Idle({})`). It bails on a member-expression callee, so `Todo.ClickedDelete({})` through a namespace import needs your eyes.

No-field tagged structs called with `({})`: `Idle({})`, `Work({})`, `ClickedSubmit({})`. Should be `Idle()`, `Work()`, `ClickedSubmit()`. Both compile; exemplars are uniform on the no-arg form.

### `hand-rolled-async-state`

A hand-written `Idle | Loading | Error | Ok` union for remote data, when `AsyncData` ships it: `AsyncData.Schema(DataSchema, ErrorSchema)` yields the schema plus constructors for `Idle`, `Loading`, `Refreshing`, `Failure`, `Stale`, and `Success`, with `isPending`, `hasData`, `match`, `revalidate`, and the rest of the module's operations. `repos/foldkit/examples/weather/src/main.ts` is the canonical use.

The two states a hand-rolled union usually lacks are the ones that matter: `Refreshing` (data on screen while a reload runs) and `Stale` (data on screen after a reload failed). A union without them forces a refetch to blank the screen or an error to discard good data. Flag a hand-rolled union unless the states genuinely aren't remote-data states.

### `array-type-syntax`

`readonly Command<Message>[]` and `MyType[]` should be `ReadonlyArray<Command<Message>>` and `Array<MyType>`. Cosmetic, but every exemplar is uniform.

## Routing and views

### `hard-coded-route-paths`

`foldkit/no-hardcoded-route-strings` covers `Href`, `pushUrl`, and `replaceUrl`. Anything routing through another helper needs your eyes.

`Href('/')`, `pushUrl('/new')`, ``Href(`/tag/${name}`)``. Routers are bidirectional; call them as printers: `Href(homeRouter())`, `pushUrl(newLinkRouter())`, `Href(tagFilterRouter({ tag: name }))`.

### `unkeyed-list-rows`

`foldkit/keyed-required-for-mapped-rows` and `foldkit/no-array-index-view-keys` cover part of this, but the first is narrow: it fires only when the callback references `.id` and the row element is one of li/div/tr/article/section. Rows keyed on a slug or name, and rows returning `h.a`, `h.button`, or a component call, pass it silently. A green lint does not clear this one; read the map sites.

Rows in `Array.map(items, ...)` carrying `OnClick` handlers bound to specific item ids, without `keyed('li')(item.id, ...)`, are a snabbdom patching bug. Delete from the middle and the OLD row's click handler patches onto a different row: the user clicks "Delete B" and A is deleted. Invisible until a delete or reorder happens mid-list.

### `data-derived-keys`

A `keyed(...)` whose key is built from displayed data (concatenated booleans, a formatted summary string, a restated field the subtree renders) is keying used as change detection. The key changes while the same conceptual thing stays on screen, so every content change tears the subtree down, discarding focus, scroll position, and open `details` elements. Keys carry identity: a branch tag, a route tag, a stable id. If removing the key leaves the same structure rendering at that position, remove it.

### `flat-parent-message-union`

`Message = S.Union([ChildMessage, ParentLocalMessage])` makes every parent handler know the child's tag names, and the child can't grow its vocabulary without leaking into the parent. The canonical Submodel pattern wraps: `const GotChildMessage = m('GotChildMessage', { message: Child.Message })`, and the parent's `M.tagsExhaustive` has one `GotChildMessage` case delegating to `Child.update(model.child, message)`. Flat unions work for trivial cases but don't isolate child concerns. Suggest `Got*` wrapping for any Submodel likely to grow, or any child that needs an OutMessage.

## Accessibility

### `hand-rolled-widgets`

Raw `input`, `textarea`, `button`, `dialog`, anything with `role="menu"` / `role="dialog"` / `role="tab"`. `@foldkit/ui` ships `Input`, `Textarea`, `Button`, `Dialog`, `Menu`, `Tabs` and the rest. A hand-rolled element without a `// NOTE:` explaining why is a BLOCKER, not a style preference: hand-rolling skips accessibility work.

### `a11y-gaps`

For anything outside `@foldkit/ui` coverage: label/input pairing via `For(id)` + `Id(id)`, dynamic errors announced via `Role('alert')` or `AriaLive('polite')`, icon-only buttons with `AriaLabel`, external links with `Rel('noopener noreferrer')`, exactly one `h1` per route, semantic landmarks over `div` soup. Color is never the only carrier of meaning.

### `aria-role-confusion`

Checkboxes use `Role('checkbox')` + `AriaChecked(boolean)`; screen readers announce "checkbox, checked." Toggle buttons (Play/Pause, Bold on/off) use `AriaPressed(string)`; screen readers announce "toggle button, pressed." Ask: does the label say "Mark as done" (checkbox) or "toggle bold" (pressed button)?

## Testing

### `missing-scene-test`

`scene.test.ts` is REQUIRED at Tier 3+. Absent is a BLOCKER, not a QUALITY item.

Present but with no `expect(...)` and no interactive resolution in a block is the same finding. A `scene(...)` that only does `given(model)` verifies that the view doesn't throw and nothing else.
