# Prepare the workspace for a Claude Code cloud session.

# Cloud sandboxes are provisioned from a cached working-directory snapshot. That
# snapshot can carry three kinds of state that look like pre-existing branch
# problems but are not:
#
#   * Stale node_modules    -> downstream typecheck/build hits "Property X does
#     not exist on type Y" because the wrong dependency version resolved.
#   * Missing dist/         -> downstream typecheck fails with "Cannot find
#     module 'foldkit'" because foldkit's package.json `exports` map points at
#     dist/.
#   * Stale untracked files -> a never-committed leftover baked into the
#     snapshot reappears as an untracked file every session, tripping the
#     "commit and push" Stop hook into nagging about work nobody did.
#
# Reconciling node_modules to the lockfile, building the prerequisite packages,
# and removing known stale leftovers eliminates all three classes of phantom
# problem before the agent runs any checks.

# on "still untracked" so a file legitimately committed here later is untouched.
