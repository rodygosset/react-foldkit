# Foldkit UI

## What is Foldkit UI?

Foldkit UI is a set of headless, accessible UI components. Each component is renderless. You provide the markup and styling through a toView callback, and Foldkit UI provides the accessibility attributes, keyboard navigation, and (where applicable) state management.

## Installation

`@foldkit/ui` is a separate package from `foldkit`. Projects scaffolded by `create-foldkit-app` from an example that uses UI components already include it. Its peer dependencies are `foldkit` and `effect`, which every Foldkit project already has. Add it to any other project with:

```sh
npm install @foldkit/ui
```

## Two categories

Foldkit UI components fall into two categories, distinguished by whether they carry state.

Stateful [Submodels](/core/submodel) (Menu, Listbox, Combobox, Calendar, Dialog, Popover, among others) manage their own Model, Message, update, and OutMessage. You embed them via h.submodel and handle their events by pattern-matching the OutMessage in your update.

Stateless render helpers (Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Radio Group, Checkbox, Switch, Disclosure, Fieldset, Nav) are called directly with a ViewConfig and your builder, and return Html. They bundle ARIA and data attributes onto consumer-rendered DOM. No Model, no h.submodel wiring. The controlled helpers dispatch the Messages returned by their config callbacks, and the builder you pass is what determines the Message type those callbacks must return, so there is no type argument to write. The “Kind” column in the table below marks which is which.

## Showcase

The [UI Showcase](/example-apps/ui-showcase) example demonstrates every component with styled, interactive examples. It’s a good reference for how to wire up component state, handle Messages, and compose views.
