Foldkit is a TypeScript frontend framework built on [Effect](https://effect.website/) and architected like [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/). One Model, one update function, one way to do things. No hooks, no local state, no hidden mutations. It's all in on Effect with no escape hatch, though a program doesn't have to own the whole page: [`Runtime.embed`](https://foldkit.dev/core/embedding) runs a Foldkit widget inside any existing app, React included.

Your Model is a [Schema](https://effect.website/docs/schema/introduction/) and side effects are values you return, not callbacks you fire. If you know Effect, Foldkit feels natural. If you're new to it, Foldkit is a good way in. Coming from React? [Start here](https://foldkit.dev/react/coming-from-react), or read the [same pixel-art editor built in both frameworks](https://foldkit.dev/react/foldkit-vs-react-side-by-side).

> [!NOTE]
> Foldkit is pre-1.0. The core API is stable, but breaking changes may occur in minor releases. See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Get Started

`create-foldkit-app` scaffolds a complete setup with Tailwind, TypeScript, [Oxlint](https://foldkit.dev/tooling/oxlint-plugin), Prettier, and the Vite plugin for state-preserving HMR, starting from an example you choose.

```bash
npx create-foldkit-app@latest
```

## Counter

A complete Foldkit program. State lives in a single Model, events become Messages, and a pure function handles every transition. `main.ts` defines the program and `entry.ts` boots the runtime, so `main.ts` stays importable from tests without booting a runtime as a side effect.

```ts
// src/main.ts
import { Match as M, Schema as S } from 'effect'
import { Command, Runtime } from 'foldkit'
import { Document, HtmlBuilder } from 'foldkit/html'
import { m } from 'foldkit/message'
import { evo } from 'foldkit/struct'

// MODEL

export const Model = S.Struct({ count: S.Number })
export type Model = typeof Model.Type

// MESSAGE

const ClickedDecrement = m('ClickedDecrement')
const ClickedIncrement = m('ClickedIncrement')
const ClickedReset = m('ClickedReset')

export const Message = S.Union([
  ClickedDecrement,
  ClickedIncrement,
  ClickedReset,
])
export type Message = typeof Message.Type

// UPDATE

export const update = (
  model: Model,
  message: Message,
): readonly [Model, ReadonlyArray<Command.Command<Message>>] =>
  M.value(message).pipe(
    M.withReturnType<
      readonly [Model, ReadonlyArray<Command.Command<Message>>]
    >(),
    M.tagsExhaustive({
      ClickedDecrement: () => [evo(model, { count: count => count - 1 }), []],
      ClickedIncrement: () => [evo(model, { count: count => count + 1 }), []],
      ClickedReset: () => [evo(model, { count: () => 0 }), []],
    }),
  )

// INIT

export const init: Runtime.ApplicationInit<Model, Message> = () => [
  { count: 0 },
  [],
]

// VIEW

export const view = (model: Model, h: HtmlBuilder<Message>): Document => ({
  title: `Counter: ${model.count}`,
  body: h.div(
    [],
    [
      h.p([], [model.count.toString()]),
      h.button([h.OnClick(ClickedDecrement())], ['-']),
      h.button([h.OnClick(ClickedReset())], ['Reset']),
      h.button([h.OnClick(ClickedIncrement())], ['+']),
    ],
  ),
})
```

```ts
// src/entry.ts
import { Runtime } from 'foldkit'

import { Model, init, update, view } from './main'

const application = Runtime.makeApplication({
  Model,
  init,
  update,
  view,
  container: document.getElementById('root'),
})

Runtime.run(application)
```

## What Ships With Foldkit

A complete system, not a collection of libraries you stitch together. Each of these is documented in depth at [foldkit.dev](https://foldkit.dev).

- **Commands**: Side effects as named Effects that return Messages and are run by the runtime.
- **Routing**: Type-safe bidirectional routing from parser combinators. URLs parse to Routes, Routes build URLs.
- **Subscriptions**: External event streams declared as a function of the Model.
- **Managed Resources**: Model-driven lifecycle for WebSockets, AudioContext, and other long-lived handles.
- **Mount**: The seam where view code hands a real DOM element to a third-party library that owns its own DOM.
- **Submodels**: A self-contained Model, update, and view that a parent embeds, wrapping child Messages in a `Got*` envelope.
- **OutMessage**: A typed channel for a child Submodel to emit domain events up to its parent.
- **Embedding**: Run a Foldkit program inside a host app through Schema-typed Ports with `Runtime.embed`.
- **UI Components**: Accessible, keyboard-friendly primitives in the `@foldkit/ui` package.
- **Field Validation**: Per-field validation state modeled as a discriminated union.
- **Virtual DOM**: Declarative views with lazy memoization and keyed diffing, powered by [Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom).
- **DevTools**: In-browser overlay for inspecting Messages, Model, and Commands, with time-travel.
- **DevTools MCP**: Expose a running app to AI agents over the Model Context Protocol.
- **Crash View and Reporting**: A custom fallback UI when the update loop throws, plus a report callback.
- **Story Testing**: Exercise the update function directly, resolving Commands inline. No mocks, no fake timers.
- **Scene Testing**: Drive your real view the way a user does, with accessible locators. No browser required.
- **Slow Warnings**: Development warnings when update, view, patch, or Subscription extraction exceeds its budget.
- **HMR**: Vite plugin with state-preserving hot module replacement. Change your view, keep your state.

## Correctness You (And Your LLM) Can See

Every state change flows through one update function, and every side effect is declared explicitly. You don't have to hold a mental model of what runs when, you can point at it. That's what makes Foldkit unusually AI-friendly: the property that makes the code easy for humans to reason about makes it easy for an LLM to generate and review.
